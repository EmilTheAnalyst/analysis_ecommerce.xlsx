**Excel_Pivoting_Ecommerce**
Project Overview This project involves analyzing and visualizing an ecommerce dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes information about users, products, prices, discounts, and payment methods, and consists of 7 columns: user_id, Product_id, Category, Price, Discount%, Final Price, and Payment_Method. The goal was to clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset to uncover insights and patterns using Excel.

Steps Undertaken Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Corrected data types for all columns. Resolved inconsistencies such as: Mixed data types (e.g., dates and numbers in the Final Price column). Incorrect or invalid numbers in the Discount% column. Trimmed extra spaces in the Payment_Method column. Added a new column, Discount Price, calculated from Price and Discount%.

**Data Analysis:**

Performed price analysis using pivot tables to calculate: Total Price, Discount, and Final Price for each product. Analyzed payment methods by summing the transactions of each category per month.

**Visualization:**

Created graphs in Excel to visualize: Price summaries for each product. Payment method distribution across categories and months.

Tools Used Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization)
